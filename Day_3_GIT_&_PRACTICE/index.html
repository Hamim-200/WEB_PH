            <li>Introduction</li>
            <p>C programming is one of the most influential and widely used programming languages in computer science. Known for its efficiency, flexibility, and close-to-hardware capabilities, C has shaped modern programming and remains a foundational skill for developers worldwide. This article explores the origins, theoretical foundations, and core concepts of C programming for beginners.</p>

            <li>The Origins of C</li>
            <p>C was created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972. It was developed as an enhancement of the B programming language, which itself was based on BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language). C was initially designed for system programming and the development of operating systems. Its first significant application was the rewriting of the UNIX operating system, which helped establish C as a powerful and portable language.C became widely adopted due to its simplicity and efficiency. By the late 1970s, it had grown beyond its initial purpose and was used for developing applications, embedded systems, and more. The publication of "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie in 1978 further cemented its status and introduced a formal description of the language, often referred to as K&R C.</p>

            <li>Theoretical Foundations of C</li>
            <p>C programming is a procedural language, emphasizing a sequence of commands and structured programming techniques. Here are some key theoretical concepts: <b>Close-to-Hardware Nature</b> C provides low-level memory access, which makes it suitable for system-level programming. Pointers, direct memory manipulation, and efficient control over hardware resources allow developers to interact closely with the underlying architecture. <b>Portability</b>One of C’s major strengths is its portability. Programs written in C can be compiled and executed on different machines with minimal changes, thanks to its close alignment with assembly language and efficient compilation. <b>Procedural Paradigm</b>C follows a procedural approach, breaking down tasks into smaller functions. This methodology emphasizes code reuse, modularity, and logical flow.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The Origins of C++</li>
            <p>C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language. Initially called "C with Classes," it introduced object-oriented features such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism to address the growing complexity of software development. The language's versatility and compatibility with C made it a popular choice for a wide range of applications, from system programming to game development. Over the years, C++ has undergone several standardizations, with the most notable being ISO/IEC 14882, ensuring consistency and modern enhancements.</p>

            <li>Theoretical Foundations of C++</li>
            <p>C++ expands on the procedural nature of C by introducing key paradigms: <b>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</b> C++ emphasizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling developers to build reusable and modular code. <b>Standard Template Library (STL)</b> STL provides a collection of template classes and functions for data structures and algorithms, boosting productivity and performance. <b>Compatibility with C</b> C++ maintains backward compatibility with C, allowing seamless integration of legacy code and advanced features.</p>

            <li>Core Concepts of C++ Programming</li>
            <p>C++ is a powerful, object-oriented programming language that builds on the concepts of C, offering greater flexibility and control over system resources. Key concepts in C++ include variables, data types, and operators, which are fundamental for storing and manipulating data. C++ also introduces the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP), where programs are structured around objects and classes. A class defines the blueprint for objects, which encapsulate data and behavior. Inheritance allows one class to inherit attributes and methods from another, promoting code reuse. Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through method overriding and overloading. Encapsulation ensures that an object's data is protected from unauthorized access. Additionally, C++ includes features like pointers, memory management, templates, and exceptions, providing developers with low-level control over system resources while still supporting high-level abstractions. These core concepts make C++ versatile for a range of applications, from system software to game development and embedded systems.</p>
